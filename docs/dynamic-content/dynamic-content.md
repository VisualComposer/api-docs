# Dynamic Content

The `dynamicField` option allows to select a value from a set of custom WordPress fields, such as post title, post author, featured image, or custom meta fields.

**The dynamic content option is available only for:**

* string input fields;
* TinyMCE fields;
* attach image fields.

A plug icon is displayed right next to the field. Once clicked a dropdown with all available custom fields will be displayed. Content is grouped by type:

* Default;
* Custom Meta Field;
* Vendor Fields (WooCommerce, ACF, etc),

:::tip
All fields are public entries in a database. Private entries can be accessed via *Otherâ€¦* option. If selected, the input field will be shown to enter the name of the private field.
